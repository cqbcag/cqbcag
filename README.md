- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m cqb/TimeDust01 (Freelance 3D Artist)
- ðŸ‘€ I am a freelance 3D artist on ROBLOX, for nearly the past two years I have modelled almost exclusively body armor and other equipment for ROBLOX in the modern military genre.
-ðŸ˜€ I have extensive knowledge in Adobe Substance 3D Painter and the main modelling tool I use is Blender, but I also have basic level knowledge in other programs such as ZBrush, CLO3D(Marvelous Designer), and Plasticity3D(CAD)
